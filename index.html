                    <p class = "blurb">My senior project is a collaboration between myself and artificial intelligence, exploring the intersection of traditional art techniques and cutting-edge technology. Using 30 of my own handmade drawings as a dataset, I trained an AI model to generate images in my style, which were then used to train subsequent AI models. The result is a collection of 60 AI-generated images that showcase the capabilities of artificial intelligence and the potential for creative collaboration between humans and machines. <br><br>Through this process, I aim to highlight the capabilities of AI while also showcasing my own artwork. I believe that this collaboration represents an exciting evolution in the world of art, as it opens up new possibilities for creativity and expression. My project invites viewers to contemplate the role of technology in art-making and to engage with the unique images that emerge from this relationship between human and machine.</p>

Sounds play of these “plants” in the wind, with leaves hitting each other and producing various crashes and scrapes. A monitor is placed inside, showcasing a shift between true landscapes and landscapes produced through programming. Plastic vines seem to be overgrown and lay between the plants.<br><br>The Natural World seems to get smaller everyday. There has been much more of a focus on a contained nature, one seen in plastic flora and behind an LED screen. This piece shows the next step in this evolution, The “Natural” World.</p>

                    <p class = "blurb">This work was inspired by my interests in the idea of the perception of self versus how I am viewed by others. I collaborated with two Black female photographers, Charli and Summer, and I asked of them what they believed to be my best angles. I also captured images of myself with the assistance of a close friend of mine Naomi Antonia. I also wanted it to speak to the representation of dark-skin Black women by other Black women who I felt would do me the honor of representing me in a way that would capture my “beauty”.</p>

                    <p class = "blurb">Combining his background in performance and time-based new media, Kadir finds his interests lie within a broad variety of mediums. Exploring how the body has its limits, exploring the idea of belonging, as well as time and space, he curates and produces visual languages that are politically motivated, challenge traditional exhibition practices, and manipulate structure and its intention.
                    <br><br>
                    As the current Public Arts Coordinator at Purchase College, Kadir holds a passion for curating artwork intended for the public eye, and the relationship between artwork and a public audience. 
                    <br><br>
                    Kadir anticipates furthering his intellectual rigor by beginning his studies as an MFA/MA student later this year: earning an MFA in Sculpture, and MA in Art History, at Purchase College. </p>
